**ClassicACE is an Asheron's Call Emulator based on ACEmulator. It adds rulesets which change the gameplay rules:**
- *Infiltration Ruleset:* Replicates the gameplay of the Infiltration event which was released by Turbine in February 2005.
- *CustomDM Ruleset:* A variation of the Infiltration ruleset with a lot of tweaks and changes, a truly custom Asheron's Call experience.
- *EoR Ruleset:* End of Release - replicates the gameplay as it was at the time Asheron's Call was sunsetted. This is ACEmulator's default behavior and is included here for completeness and code compatibility.

A HUGE THANK YOU TO DEKARU, ADVAN, and the ENTIRE CLASSICACE TEAM!

** This server is forked from Dekaru's CustomDM. This is a modified version of that that has a mission of the following:**
- *Approachable, Yet Challenging PvE Focused implementation*
- *Group-Focused content with significant interplay of skills during combat*
- *Aggressive TAR to offset macro'ing/metas*

** Initial and Up to Date Changes:**
- *Appraise effectiveness signficantly boosted*
- *Shield more effective especially early game*
- *One-handed spears will now pierce one target (Think Cleave but a very narrow cone) that is behind your primary*
- *Axes have a critical damage bonus modifier*
- *Axe/Mace skill has a debuff of attributes component that is defended against by the Deception skill (yes, mobs will use this against you!)*
- *Sneak is an active detaunt*
- *Deception taunt more effective*
- *Reduced Cooldown on Assess debuff*
- *Increased XP cost to remove vitae penalty*
- *No items drop; only pyreals (This is in-line with our focus on brutal content with a casual appproach)*
- *Life Magic Leyline Amulet opportunities adjusted to obtain significantly better results*
- *Robes have significant Mana conversion bonus*
- *Endurance/Strength Natural Resistance requirements lowered*
